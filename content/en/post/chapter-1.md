Why john mayer's music just "works" ?

How his lyrics can successfully implant false memories, yet they feel so real ?

What makes his guitar playing so distinct ?

Theory wise, how to achieve this sound and feel ?

In this blog, i'll try to share my findings, and the techniques that i have learned
over the years, studying john mayer.
