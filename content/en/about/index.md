And also, it's pretty awesome to look back and see all the cool stories we've gathered along the way"

This sections feels like the back of a book, where they write about the writer. Well, i am not a writer, so not sure what to brag about here, but anyway, i'll try.

I am a software engineer, interested in distributed systems, data intensive systems. I am currently exploring AI and data cataloging systems. In my free time, i like to play my guitars, and i am also planning on writing an album.
